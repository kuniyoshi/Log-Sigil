NAME
    Log::Sigil - show warnings with sigil prefix

SYNOPSIS
      filename: synopsis.pl
       1 use Log::Sigil qw( swarn swarn2 );
       2
       3 sub foo {
       4     swarn( "foo" );
       5     swarn( "bar" );
       6 }
       7
       8 swarn( "foo" );
       9
      10 foo( );
      11
      12 swarn( "bar" );

      above shows:
      === foo by synopsis.pl[8]: main::
      +++ foo by synopsis.pl[4]: main::foo
      +++ bar by synopsis.pl[5]: main::foo
      === bar by synopsis.pl[12]: main::

DESCRIPTION
    This module helps printing debug by adding prefix to the warning
    message. The prefix will change if caller changes, meaning 'foo' sub,
    and 'bar' sub have different prefix each other.

    i do printing debug frequently. In debugging, my warning messages became
    too big to read. When i in trouble (yes, so doing printing debug), i do
    not want to remove the warning messages. Once i thought it is needed, it
    is needed twice, and more. Thus, i need a format which can read warning
    messages even if that is big.

EXPORTS
    swarn
    swarn2

FUNCTIONS
    swarn
        Works all of this module does. That are, adding prefix, setting up
        filename and line, and, setting up package and subroutine.

    swarn2
        Same as swarn, but has a 1 bias. This is useful when calling from
        some handler subroutine, such as;

          ( my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new )->add_handler(
              request_prepare => sub {
                  my( $req, $ua, $h ) = @_;
                  swarn2( "Adding If-Modified-Since..." );
                  $req->...
                  swarn2( "Now req has: ", $req->header( "If-Modified-Since" ) );
              },
          );

        swarn does not work well this case; this has deep frames.

        Oops, that case needs more depth. Increase BIAS value these cases.

          ( my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new )->add_handler(
              request_prepare => sub {
                  my( $req, $ua, $h ) = @_;
                  local $Log::Sigil::BIAS += 4;
                  swarn( "Adding" );
              },
          );
          $ua->get( "http://example.com/" );
          # --> +++ Adding by .../LWP/UserAgent.pm[243]: LWP::UserAgent::prepare_request

PROPERTIES
    SIGILS
        Is a array which are used as prefix.

    TIMES
        Specifies how many sigil is repeated.

    SEPARATOR
        Will be placed between sigils and log message.

    BIAS
        Controls caller frame depth.
